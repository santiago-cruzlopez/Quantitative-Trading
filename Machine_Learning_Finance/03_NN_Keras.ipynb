    "1. Training Approaches:\n",
    " - Rule-Based: Define rules for outputs based on inputs.\n",
    " - Model Training: Adjust weights on a dataset to improve predictions.\n",

    " - Inputs: OHLCV data.\n",
    " - Output: Next day’s Close price (actual y and predicted y').\n",
    "3. Cost Function:\n",
    " - Measures prediction error:\n",
    "  $$ C = \\sum_{}^{}\\frac{1}{2}(\\widehat{y}-y)^{2} $$\n",
    " - Objective: Minimize this cost.\n",
    "4. Training Process:\n",
    " - Compute initial cost with a set of weights.\n",
    " - Adjust weights using backpropagation to reduce the cost iteratively.\n",
    "5. Optimization:\n",
    " - Evaluate cost across multiple weight configurations to find the best ones.\n",

    "By refining weights based on error, the neural network learns to predict stock prices effectively."
